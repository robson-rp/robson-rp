# 👋 Hi, I'm Robson Paulo

💻 I'm a **Software Engineer** focused on building **intelligent applications**. I currently work with **mobile and backend development**, and I'm expanding into the field of **AI Engineering**.

🎯 Passionate about turning ideas into digital products — combining **clean code, practical design, and AI-powered solutions** to solve real-world problems.

🌱 I'm currently deepening my knowledge in:
- **Python for AI and automation**

- Integrating AI into Flutter apps, Node.js and Laravel backends

💞️ I'm open to collaborating on open-source projects, especially those involving **AI, mobile development, and educational tools**.
